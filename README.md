In the changing world of online shopping, understanding and predicting how customers behave is crucial, for
the success and satisfaction of businesses. This project aims
to create a machine learning model that can analyze customer
retention in e commerce platforms. Our goal is to predict when
customers are likely to make purchases during their online
browsing sessions. By doing marketing teams can tailor their
strategies effectively. We will use data sets and perform thorough
data pre-processing, including cleaning and feature engineering
to prepare for a detailed analysis of customer behavior. Through
techniques we will uncover insights into both the qualitative
and quantitative aspects of consumer behavior. Afterward we
will select features. Utilize advanced machine learning algorithms like Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines and
K Nearest Neighbors to build predictive models. These models
will be rigorously evaluated using metrics such as AUC ROC,
Precision, Recall F 1 Score and Confusion Matrix to ensure their
accuracy and reliability. The expected outcome of this project is a
machine learning tool that provides insights to enhance customer
experiences while fostering brand loyalty and driving financial
growth for e commerce businesses. This research not contributes
to discussions on customer retention strategies but also offers
practical recommendations, for e commerce platforms aiming to
improve user engagement and retention.
